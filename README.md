#ChemJs
I didnt know what to call it and I figured with this name if you want me to do other stuff I can just add them into the same liburary

Here is a link to the paper that talked about the algorithems

This is writen using typescript. Here is the docs for it:

an easy typescript compiler is the visual studio code thing for linux

The improvements that I have made to the algorithem that I used was to add a spacer atom to the middle of all the rings
this spaces them out better and is less likely to end up with the rings folded over. Which was a common problem before

The code that takes the smile key and turns it into javascript objects needs work but the basic outline is there.
The most important thing in my opinion atm is to get the drawing better.
current limitations of the code are no square brakets at symbols hash symbols or dollar signs
so none of these []@#$ other than that it should work.
